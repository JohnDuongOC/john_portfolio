title: "Google Data Analyst Capstone - Cyclist"
---

This is my Google Data Analyst capstone project where I provide insights from a dataset to help create a marketing campaign. I used Excel to organize the time format, deleted blank unusable rows, and found null values from improper calculations. Followed by using SQL to derive actionable insights that I then later visualized with Tableau.
